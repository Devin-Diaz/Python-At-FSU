    Include accessor and mutator methods for each attribute.
    Then, write a program that presents a menu to let the user perform the following actions until the
    user selects to quit the program:

    Add a new employee to the dictionary (Ask for all employee details, create an Employee
    object with those details, and store the Employee object in a dictionary using the employee
    ID number as the key; if the employee already exists, print that the ID already exists)

    Look up an employee in the dictionary (Ask for an employee ID and print all the details of
    that employee; if such an employee ID does not exist, print that the specified ID was not
    found)

    Change an existing employee's name, department, and job title in the dictionary (Ask for
    an employee ID and if such an ID exists, ask for all other details and update the dictionary
    value for that ID; if such an employee ID does not exist, print that the specified ID was not
    found)

    Delete an employee from the dictionary (Ask for an employee ID and if such an ID exists,
    delete the related employee entry from the dictionary; if such an employee ID does not
    exist, print that the specified ID was not found)

Quit the program (You may print any appropriate message (e.g. Good Bye!!))
