INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTING:

**COMPUTER BASICS**
Computers are programmed. They are designed to do any job that a program tells it to do.
Program - Set of instructions a computer follows to perform task. Known as software. 
Programmer - Someone who designs, creates, and tests computer programs. Known as software developers.

**HARDWARE OVERVIEW**
Hardware - The physcal components that make up a computer. A computer is a system composed of these components that all work together.
Typical major components of a computer:
    Central processing unit (CPU)
    Main memory
    Secondary storage devices
    Input and output devices

CPU - Most important part of a computer, without this software cannot be ran. Microprocessors are CPUs located on small chips

Main memory - where computer stores a program while program is running, and data used by the program. This is known as RAM

RAM - random access memory, CPU is able to quickly access data in RAM. RAM data is volitile meaning data is erased when computer is shut off

Secondary data - holds data for long periods of time. Programs are stored here. They are loaded to main memory (RAM) when needed. 
Some examples of secondary data are, disk drives, SSD, HDD, flash memory and optical devices

Input: data the computer collects from people and other devices.
Input device: components that collect the data, keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, camera

Output: data produced by the computer for other people or devices, text, audio, or bit stream
Output device: formats and presents output. Video display, printer, USB drives

**SOFTWARE OVERVIEW**
Everything the computer does is controlled by software.
    Application software - Programs that make computer useful everyday, word processing, emails, games, and web browsers
    System software - programs that control and manage basic operations of a computer:
        OS - controls operations of hardware components
        Utility programs - performs specific task to enhance computer operations or safeguard data
        Software dev tools - Used to create, modify, and test software programs

**HOW DATA IS STORED**
All data in computer is stored in binary, 0's an 1's which represemt bits.
Byte - enough memory to store a letter or small number
    Made up of 8 bits, a bit is an electrical compnent that has a positive or negative switch (on/off switch)
    The on/off pattern of bits in a byte represent data stored in the byte. 


**HOW A PROGRAM WORKS**
1. Data which is composed of 0's and 1's is stored in secondary memory
2. it gets loaded to main memory (RAM) when needed.
3. First instruction gets fetched to the CPU
4. CPU decodes the instruction to determine which operation to perform
5. CPU executes the instruction (operation)

Interpreter (Python): An interpreter translates and executes a program line-by-line, converting each statement into machine code one at 
a time and immediately executing it. This means that it starts executing the program as soon as it starts reading it, without looking 
at the entire program in advance. This can make debugging easier since errors are found and can be dealt with one line at a time, but 
can result in slower overall execution compared to a compiler.

Compiler (Java, C langs): A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before execution begins. This process involves reading 
the whole program, optimizing it, and then converting it into a standalone executable file. This upfront effort can take more time initially, 
but it generally results in faster execution since the machine code is directly run by the computerâ€™s processor. Compilers also perform more 
complex analysis and optimizations on the code, which can improve efficiency and performance.
