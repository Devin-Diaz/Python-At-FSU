Hello my name is Devin Diaz,
I am a Computer Science major at Framingham State University.
I aspire to be a full stack software developer at a big tech company.
Outside of academics, I love to play soccer, train BJJ, and hang out with family and friends.
My favorite TV shows are, Blue Lock, AoAshi, and Naruto.
That is all.
