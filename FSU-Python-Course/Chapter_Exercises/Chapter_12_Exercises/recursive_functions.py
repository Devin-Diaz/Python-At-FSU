'''
Recursive Printing 
Design a recursive function that accepts an integer argument, n, and prints 
the numbers 1 up through n. Test the function.

Recursive Multiplication
Design a recursive function that accepts two arguments into the parameters x and y. 
The function should return the value of x times y. Remember, multiplication can be performed as repeated 
addition as follows: 7 Ã— 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 (To keep the function simple, assume x and y will 
always hold positive nonzero integers). Test the function.
