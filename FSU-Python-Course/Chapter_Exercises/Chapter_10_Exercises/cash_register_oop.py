'''
Cash Register - This exercise assumes you have created the RetailItem class (above). Create a
CashRegister class that can be used with the RetailItem class. The CashRegister class should be able
to internally keep a list of RetailItem objects.
The class should have the following methods:

A method named purchase_item that accepts a RetailItem object as an argument. Each time
the purchase_item method is called, the RetailItem object that is passed as an argument
should be added to the list.

A method named get_total that returns the total price of all the RetailItem objects stored in
the CashRegister object's internal list.
ï‚§ A method named show_items that displays data about the RetailItem objects stored in the
CashRegister object's internal list.

A method named clear that should clear the CashRegister object's internal list.
Demonstrate the CashRegister class in a program that allows the user to select several items for
purchase. When the user is ready to check out, the program should display a list of all the items he
or she has selected for purchase, as well as the total price.
